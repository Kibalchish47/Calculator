# Basic calculator built in Rust

This is a basic calculator, written with @Sammy99Jsp's assistance, 

It includes basic functionality, such as : 
- Various basic operations
  - Addition (+)
  - Substraction (-)
  - Multiplication (*)
  - Division (/)
  - Exponents (**)
  - Modulus (%)
- Error handling (the program repeats the question until the user provides a satisfactory answer)
- "Memory" feature that allows the user to reuse the previous output of the program (the keyword being "mem")

> Note: The calculator was rewritten and improved once I came back to rust in October 2024.
