This is a calculator that I have written along with Sammy69jsp. 
It includes basic functionality like adding, substracting, multiplying, dividing, doing modulus and exponents with 2 numbers inputted by the user. 
Also there is something called a "memory", which is basically the result of your previous calculation that can be used as a placeholder (enter "m" instead of the number).
