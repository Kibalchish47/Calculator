# Basic calculator built in Rust

This is a basic calculator, written with @Sammy99Jsp's assistance, intended to teach me how to write code in Rust.

It includes basic functionality, such as : 
- Various basic operations
  - Addition (+)
  - Substraction (-)
  - Multiplication (*)
  - Division (/)
  - Exponents (**)
  - Modulus (%)
- Error handling (the program repeats the question until the user provides a satisfactory answer).
- "mem" feature (as in "memory"), which allows the user to reuse the previous output of the program.
- "exit" feature, which safely terminates the program.

> Note: The calculator was rewritten and improved once I came back to Rust in October 2024.
