This is a calculator that I have written along with Sammy69jsp, to try to learn Rust.

It includes basic functionality, such as : 

- Addition (+)
- Substraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)
- Exponents (**)
- Modulus (%)

To use the previous value you calculated (the so-called "memory"), enter "m" instead of the number.
