This is a calculator that I have written along with Sammy69jsp. 

It includes basic functionality, such as : 

-Addition,

-Substraction, 

-Multiplication, 

-Division, 

-Exponents, 

-Modulus, 

Also there is a little functionnality called "memory", which is basically the result of your previous calculation that can be used as a placeholder (enter "m" instead of the number).
